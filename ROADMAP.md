# Roadmap

Rails 7.1 added a basic `/up` endpoint via `Rails::HealthController`, but it only verifies the app boots — no dependency checks, no pluggability, no configuration. `rails_health_checks` fills that gap as a production-grade, extensible health check engine with pluggable checks, a clean configuration DSL, and structured JSON responses that monitoring tools can consume.
